# Vallox

Control your **Vallox** heat recovery ventilation unit (MVHR) from Gladys Assistant: profiles
(home, away, boost, fireplace), fan speeds, supply air temperatures, and every sensor of the unit
(temperatures, humidity, CO2, filter). Scene triggers, scene actions and a dashboard widget come
with it.

Everything stays on your local network: the integration talks to the unit the way its own web
interface does. No cloud account, no internet access needed.

## Supported units

Vallox units with the **MV** controller and a network port, which have a web interface reachable
at `http://<unit address>`: Vallox 51/90/96/99/101/110/125/139/145/245 MV, ValloPlus 180/240/270/350/
370/510/850 MV, ValloMulti 200/300 MV, TSK Multi MV, and the Helios KWL units built on the same
controller.

Older units without a network port (Digit SE, Digit 2…) are not supported.

## Before you start

1. Connect the unit to your network (cable on the unit's Ethernet port).
2. Give it a **fixed IP address** in your router (DHCP reservation): the integration finds the
   unit by its address.
3. Check that `http://<that address>` opens the Vallox web interface in a browser, from a
   computer on the same network as Gladys.

## Installation

In Gladys, go to **Integrations**, search for **Vallox** and install it.

## Configuration

| Field                  | What to put                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IP address of the unit | The address of the unit, e.g. `192.168.1.50`. Several units: separate with commas.  |
| Refresh interval (s)   | How often the unit is read. 60 s by default, 15 s minimum.                          |
| Filter warning (days)  | The "Filter change due" trigger fires when the filter life left reaches this value. |

Save, then click **Test the connection**: the answer gives the model, the firmware, the profile and
the temperatures of each unit, or the reason why it did not answer.

Then go to **Discover** in the integration and create the device.

## The device

The unit becomes one Gladys device, named after its model. It is identified by the unique id the
unit carries: changing its IP address later does not create a new device.

| Feature                             | Type            | What it does                                            |

| Fan speed (home/away/boost)         | setting (%)     | Fan speed of each profile                               |

| Boost / fireplace time left         | duration (min)  | Time left of the running boost or fireplace mode        |
| Filter change in                    | duration (days) | Days left before the next filter change                 |

The device card shows a **local** badge while the unit answers, **unreachable** when it does not.

## Scenes

### Triggers

| Trigger                      | When                                                                     | Variables                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ventilation profile changed  | The profile changed from the unit's panel, its app or a timer            | unit name, new profile, previous profile  |
| Ventilation alarm            | A new alarm is active (fan fault, frozen cell, dirty filters…)           | unit name, severity, alarm, code, message |
| Filter change due            | The filter life left reached the number of days set in the configuration | unit name, days left, change date         |
| Ventilation unit unreachable | The unit stopped answering (two reads in a row failed)                   | unit name, address                        |

Each trigger can be limited to one unit, and "profile changed" to some profiles, "alarm" to a
severity.

Orders given by Gladys (dashboard, scenes, widget) never fire "profile changed": a scene that
reacts to a profile change and changes it again cannot loop.

Profile values in the variables: `home`, `away`, `boost`, `fireplace`, `extra`.

### Actions

| Action                         | What it does                                                   | Result for the next actions                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set the ventilation profile    | Home, away, boost or fireplace; optional duration in minutes   | profile                                                           |
| Set the fan speed of a profile | Fan speed (%) of the home, away or boost profile               | fan speed                                                         |
| Record a filter change         | The filters were changed today: the unit restarts its reminder | next change date                                                  |
| Read the ventilation values    | Reads the unit now                                             | profile, temperatures, humidity, CO2, fan speed, filter days left |

Example: _when the bathroom humidity goes above 75 %, set the profile to boost for 30 minutes_.

## Dashboard widget

Add the **Vallox ventilation** widget to a dashboard. It shows:

- live tiles: indoor and outdoor temperature, fan speed, and CO2 (or humidity, or supply air);
- a status list: profile and time left, heat exchanger state (heat recovery, bypass, defrost),
  filter change, alarms, connection;
- three buttons: **Home**, **Away**, **Boost**.

With several units, pick the unit in the widget settings.

## Configuration screen buttons

- **Test the connection**: reads each unit now and tells what it found.
- **Filters changed today**: after changing the filters, choose the unit; its reminder restarts
  from today.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                       | What to check                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "No answer from 192.168.1.50" | The address, the cable, and that `http://<address>` opens in a browser on Gladys' network. |
| The device is not in Discover | The unit must have answered once: click **Test the connection**, then **Discover** again.  |
| Humidity or CO2 stays empty   | The unit has no such sensor: the value is not published.                                   |
| The values arrive late        | Lower the refresh interval (15 s minimum).                                                 |
| The Vallox app stops working  | The unit accepts few connections at a time: avoid a refresh interval below 30 s.           |

The integration logs (Integrations → Vallox → Logs) say which unit failed and why.

## Privacy

The integration only talks to the address you typed, on your local network (port 80). Nothing is
sent to Vallox or to any other service. The only file it writes is `/data/units.json`, which keeps
the id, model and firmware of the units already met.
